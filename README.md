# hello-world
This is a little about me:

I am a Data Scientist and Engineer. I love mathematics, software engineering and problem solving.

If I'm not learning something new, solving a difficult problem or building something valuable, then I probably shouldn't be involved with whatever that is.

Always up for a challenge.

Chad.
